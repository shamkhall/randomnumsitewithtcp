  The term random refers to any collection of data or information that has no determined order, or is chosen in a way that is unknown beforehand. For example, 5, 8, 2, 9, and 0 are single-digit numbers listed in random order. Random data may be re-ordered, or sorted, by date, name, time, age, etc., in which case its order is no longer random.

  Data can be randomly selected, or random numbers can be generated using a random seed. Computer games, web pages, programs, and encryption are a few examples of things that need random values to operate. For example, Computer Hope has a tool that randomly selects and opens a random dictionary page for Computer Hope users.
